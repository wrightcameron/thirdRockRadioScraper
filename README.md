# Third Rock Radio Web Scraper

Web Scraper to harvest all songs played on the [Third Rock Radio](https://www.thirdrockradio.net/) Internet Radio site.  Used to listen to Third Rock a bunch, but don't much anymore.  But I'd still like to know what are songs I have never heard of playing on this station, and ignore the ones I have listened too.  This scraper is used for finding all songs that have played and then keeping track of the unique songs.
